High School Computer Science Final Project (Spring 2018) 
--------------------------------------------------------

Purpose 
------- 
As my first applied JavaScript endeavor, this project serves to facilitate architects, planners, and the like to easily sketch blueprints for houses, buildings, and other structures. The simple mobile app features a toolbar for controlling features such as line width and drawing shapes. Additionally, there are several pages reserved for a blueprint, allowing the user's creation to be visualized from top, side, front, and back perspectives. 

Breakdown of Components
-----------------------
- Live animated main page 
- Multiple perspectives to view blueprint 
- Real date and time clock 
- Toolbar with controls for lines, shapes, erase, and discard
